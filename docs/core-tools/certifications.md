# 3.5 Using the Certifications Module

The **Certifications Module** in Orbix is a centralized system for administrators to input, manage, and track all employee certifications. This module is designed to handle qualifications for various NDT methods (e.g., RT, UT, PT, MT), vision tests, and any other credentials required by your company.

By maintaining a comprehensive record of all qualifications, the module provides critical insights into upcoming expiration dates, expired certifications, and any missing credentials. This ensures your team remains compliant and simplifies the entire certification management process.
