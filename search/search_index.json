It provides a structured process for auditors to review and make final determinations on radiographic inspections of welds. As technicians complete weld x-rays, the resulting DICONDE files are passed to an auditor who holds the critical responsibility of final approval. Using the RT Viewer and its integrated measurement tools, an auditor interprets the inspection data to decide if a weld meets the required specifications, needs to be re-shot, or requires rework. 2.3.1 An Auditor's Role in Orbix The auditor plays one of the most important roles within the Orbix software. They are responsible for making official audit decisions on weld inspections based on the provided radiography specifications. The auditor utilizes the RT Viewer to analyze the DICONDE file for each Inspection ID , using measurement tools to ensure the weld falls within acceptable tolerance ranges. This role is crucial for maintaining project quality and compliance, as the auditor has the final say on whether an inspection passes or fails. 2.3.2 Method 1: Auditing from the Main Data Manager You can initiate an audit directly from the central data repository. Navigate to the Main Data Manager . From the folder view in the Compliance Hub , locate the specific inspection you need to review in the weld list table. In the Action column corresponding to that Inspection ID , click the Audit button. [Screenshot: The Main Data Manager weld list table with the \"Audit\" button highlighted in the action column.] Clicking Audit will launch the RT Viewer, where you can proceed to analyze the DICONDE file. 2.3.3 Method 2: Auditing from the Dedicated Auditors Page Orbix provides a dedicated interface designed specifically for the auditing workflow. This page centralizes all incoming data requiring review. From the projects dashboard table, locate the desired project. In the Action column, click the audit icon (a magnifying glass with a plus symbol). This action navigates you to the dedicated auditors page. Here, you will find a feed of inspections ready for audit. This interface allows you to: Make audit decisions on individual welds. Search for inspections by batch. View results from the AI audit, which identifies potentially similar or anomalous joints to assist your review. [Screenshot: The dedicated auditors page showing the feed of inspections and search functions.] 2.3.4 Method 3: Auditing via Real-Time Alerts Auditors can also initiate an audit directly from real-time notifications. When a new inspection is ready for review, you may receive an alert. From this notification, you can choose to immediately Claim the audit to begin your review or Pass it to another auditor. (For comprehensive details on setting up and managing notifications, see Section 3.4: Alerts & Notifications ). 2.3.5 Making an Audit Decision After analyzing the inspection in the RT Viewer using the available measurement tools, you will formalize your decision in the Audit Section located in the viewer's sidebar. Open the Audit Section . Select Agree if the inspection meets all specifications or Disagree if it fails.

This section details the primary methods for uploading your inspection information, whether you are submitting Radiographic Testing (RT) data through our structured DICONDE workflows or managing other NDT methods and project files through the Compliance Hub . 2.1.1 Understanding Data Types in Orbix The Orbix platform is designed to handle various digital inspection workflows. It's key to understand the main data formats and how they are managed within the system. Radiographic Data (DICONDE): In our platform, radiographic data is typically supported through the DICONDE format. These are .dcm files that ensure the interoperable submission and transmission of RT data. You can submit this data using two dedicated workflows: Batch Uploads or continuous Real-Time submissions throughout the day. Other Supported Formats: We also support other NDT methods, including VT, UT (HDF5), Eddy Current, and Acoustic Emissions. Data for these methods, along with all standard file formats like PDFs, JPEGs, PNGs, Excel files, .csv files, and TIFs, is uploaded and managed through the Compliance Hub . For detailed instructions on submitting these formats, please see the article: Section 2.1.4 Non-RT Method: Uploading to the Compliance Hub . 2.1.2 RT Method 1: Batch Upload The Batch Upload method is ideal for submitting a large volume of inspection data at one time, such as at the end of a shift or a full day's work. This method allows you to upload an entire set of DICONDE files along with their corresponding examination report in a single operation. 2.1.2.1 (CRITICAL) Preparing Data for Batch Upload A precise folder structure is essential for a successful batch upload. Orbix uses this structure to automatically read and organize your data. Before uploading, arrange your files on your local machine exactly as follows: Create a single parent folder (e.g., ProjectName_YYYY-MM-DD ). (You can use anyname you like.) Inside the parent folder, create a separate subfolder for each unique Inspection ID . Name the subfolder with the exact Inspection ID . Place all DICONDE files ( .dcm or.DCM ) corresponding to a single inspection inside its respective Inspection ID subfolder. Example Structure: Batch_Upload_2025-07-03/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 WELD_001/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Shot_01.dcm \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Shot_02.dcm \u2514\u2500\u2500 WELD_002/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 Shot_01.dcm Adhering to this structure is the most critical step to ensure your data is processed correctly. 2.1.2.2 Best Practices for File Naming While the folder structure is the primary method for organization, consistent file naming is a best practice. If your workflow does not assign specific names, a simple convention like Shot_01.dcm , Shot_02.dcm , etc., within each Inspection ID folder is recommended. For advanced workflows, Orbix can use the \"Trusted Data\" option, which relies on the embedded Study, Series, and Instance tags within the DICONDE files themselves. However, when in doubt, always default to the Folder Structure method. 2.1.2.3 Step-by-Step Guide To perform a batch upload: Navigate to the upload screen. You can do this in two ways: From the Projects page, find your project and click the Add Data action icon. Navigate into your project's Main Data Manager and click the Add Data button. You will be directed to the Batch Upload page. Complete the required fields: Interpreter: Select the technician who performed the inspection. Inspection Date: Select the date from the examination report. RT Report: Drag and drop or browse to upload the corresponding examination report (e.g., PDF). Data Template: Select the option that matches your data preparation. If your specific inspection equipment is listed, select it. Otherwise, select Folder Structure . Drag and drop your single parent folder (containing all the Inspection ID subfolders) into the designated upload area. Click Upload Data . Orbix will begin processing the batch. Note: If your total batch upload size exceeds two terabytes (2 TB), you must first compress the parent folder into a single .zip file before uploading. 2.1.3 RT Method 2: Real-Time Upload 2.1.3.1 Overview The Real-Time Upload method is designed for workflows where inspection data must be submitted continuously for immediate review by remote auditors or inspectors. This provides a live feed of inspection progress and allows for rapid feedback cycles. Use this method when immediate submission is required, as opposed to end-of-day batching. 2.1.3.2 Submitting Data & Decisions To submit an inspection in real-time: From the Main Data Manager , navigate to the Add Data screen and select the Real-Time tab. Select the Technician(s) for the job. Enter a unique Inspection ID for the component being inspected. Drag and drop the corresponding DICONDE file(s) for that Inspection ID into the upload area. Click Save and Continue . The inspection is immediately submitted to the system. You can track the status of all submissions (Pending, Accepted, Rejected) in the real-time dashboard. For more information, please see the article: Understanding the Real-Time Submission Dashboard 2.1.3.3 Mapping Repairs When an inspection is rejected, you must link the new repair data to the original inspection to maintain a complete and traceable record. Orbix provides two methods to accomplish this. Method 1: From the Main Data Manager Use this method to add repair data to an existing rejected inspection. Navigate to the Main Data Manager . Locate the rejected Inspection ID that has been repaired. Click the More Options icon (three dots) in the Actions column for that inspection. From the menu, select Edit Inspection . In the Edit Inspection window, drag and drop the new DICONDE file for the repair into the designated repair upload box. [Screenshot: The 'Edit Inspection' view, highlighting the drag-and-drop area for repair data.] Method 2: During Real-Time Upload Use this method when submitting a new inspection that you know is a repair for a previously rejected item. Navigate to the Real-Time upload tab. As you fill out the submission details, locate the Repair dropdown menu. Click the dropdown to see a list of rejected Inspection IDs . Select the rejected Inspection ID to which this repair corresponds. Upload your new inspection data as usual. The link will be created automatically upon submission. 2.1.4 Non-RT Method: Uploading to the Compliance Hub In addition to managing real-time and batch Radiographic Testing (RT) workflows with DICONDE files in the Main Data Manager , the Orbix platform enables the submission of other NDT methods through the Compliance Hub . The Compliance Hub is an intelligent repository where your data is mapped directly to your project and the underlying Inspection ID . It acts as a centralized hub for all your inspection information, data, and project documentation, providing robust version control, validation, action traceability, and a complete decision history. 2.1.4.1 What it's for The Compliance Hub is designed for submitting inspection data and reports for a variety of NDT methods, including: Magnetic Particle Testing (MT) Penetrant Testing (PT) Ultrasonic Testing (UT) Visual Testing (VT) Acoustic Emission Testing (AET) Eddy Current Testing (ECT) Beyond raw inspection data, the Compliance Hub is the designated location for all project documentation. This allows you to store and manage critical files like end-user specifications, service company procedures, personnel qualification records (PQRs), and final examination reports. Each uploaded file is mapped directly to your project, ensuring a complete, traceable, and auditable record. 2.1.4.2 Accessing the Compliance Hub To navigate to the Compliance Hub for your project: From the main dashboard, navigate to the Projects Page . Locate the desired project in the list. In the Actions column for that project, click the Compliance Hub icon, which is represented by a stack of papers. Image Description: The Projects Page in Orbix. A list of projects is shown in a table. The mouse cursor is highlighting the Compliance Hub icon (a stack of papers) in the Actions column for a specific project. This action will open the project-specific Compliance Hub , where you can begin managing your files. 2.1.4.3 Recommended Folder Structure An organized folder structure is essential for maintaining data integrity and accessibility. You can create folders in a way that best suits your project workflow. For optimal organization, we recommend the following practices: Create one folder per NDT Method: Establish separate folders for MT, PT, UT, etc., to keep inspection data clearly segregated. Organize by Document Type: Create folders for Specifications , Procedures , and Examination Reports to keep them separate from raw inspection data. Create folders per Technician: On larger projects, organizing folders by the responsible technician can help streamline reviews and tracking. Image Description: The main folder view within the Compliance Hub . Several folders are displayed, demonstrating a best-practice structure. Folder names include MT - Magnetic Particle , PT - Penetrant Testing , Procedures , and Specifications . The New Folder button is visible in the top right. 2.1.4.4 Step-by-Step: Uploading Files Follow these steps to create folders and upload your inspection files. 1. Create a Folder: Click the New Folder button. In the dialog box, enter a descriptive folder name. Select a Folder Type from the dropdown menu: Inspection Data: Choose this for uploading data from NDT methods like VT, PT, MT, and ECT. Documents and Reports: Choose this for supplementary project files such as specifications, procedures, reports, PDFs, and spreadsheets. Click Create . 2. Upload Inspection Files: Navigate into the folder you created. Drag and drop your files (e.g., PDFs, images, documents) directly into the main window to upload them. 3. Manage Uploaded Files: Once a file is uploaded, you can access management options by clicking the three-dot icon on the right of the file name.
